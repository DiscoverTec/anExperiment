# Growing Darkness in Ringbriar

The group, all having been drawn in through various travels and endeavors, found themselves all in the small town of Ringbriar. Upon hearing of local trouble with the undead being spotted in town, a traveler named Edgar Rowley offers the group to investigate. Edgar is currently helping Professor Sid Bookmire from the Morgrave University. The University has a local dig at the Dkhani ruins and strange things have been occurring.

## First Kills and Tracking a Necromancer

On investigating, the party finds that a strange figure is raising skeletons and zombies in town. After fighting off several skeletons, they find more packed and stored in a barn near town. Following a path to the woods, they decide to get more information. Going back to the University delegation, they find that one of the students has been acting odd and has disappeared. The student, Keldan Frasier, has been spending a good amount of time studying a certain part of the ruins. A linguist wizard with the University delegation joins the party to assist as they track Keldan's movements. This takes them out towards the woods once more.

Seeking what appears to be a necromancer, the team continued on based on the clues, towards the lake. The party discovers entrance to an old Dkhani ruin. They gain entry and start to delve the ancient structure. After encountering several undead, including skeletons and a ghost, they have a few run ins with other denizen's of the crypt. A mimic gets the jump on the party's rogue. Giant spiders are kept at bay. A group of giant frogs are oddly negotiated with, using dead carcasses of stirges as currency for passage. The ruined structure seems to be littered with traps as well. A study with notes is found which seems to indicate that the necromancer is indeed working to uncover a great weapon here in the crypt.

## The Gelatinous Cube, Gibberlings, and Aznerax

Traveling deeper, the party runs into a gelatinous cube, literally. Progressing with more caution, they encounter a medusa. She is alarmed but agrees to let them pass if they leave one of their own behind. Lyria gambles and is able to pull a fast one on the snake haired guardian. The bard creates a spot on stone replication of Gaz and leaves it behind, as if the Medusa had petrified him herself. Rounding many corners, they encounter a frictionless hallway with a fire trap.

This does not hold them for long as they press ahead. Out of frustration, the rogue races towards the end of one hallway and much to his dismay, surprises a gathering of gibberlings. These chaotic little monsters swarm after him as the group pinches their approach off near the frictionless hallway fire trap. Utilizing their skill and the trap itself, they level the playing field, dispatching about 90% before heading forward once again.

## KIX and the Showdown with Keldan

Passing the mural, it is clear that the Dakhaani once worked with the great blue dragon Aznerax . In the mural, it depicts that at one time, he was an ally until he fell to the enemy. Through arcane resources, it was found how to bring him back, though he was twisted and darkened, as a dracolich. With much effort, he was layed low once again and entombed. It is figured out that this is what ancient weapon the necromancer is trying to bring back. Searching forward, the gnome comes across the Necromancer's familiar, Kix. Trying to sneak forward, the clink of metal alerted Kix who informed his master. Chanting began down below as the ceremony starts. Kix attempts to flee but is detained by the quick acting Kotlin. As the party gathers around the stairs down, the Necromancer redirects a fireball through his familiar, blasting the party.

Recovering from the massive blast, the party scrambles forward to stop the ceremony. Running around corners, the party reaches the chamber. Guarded by undead, the Necromancer stands at the far end of the room, finalizing the awakening. Lyria distracted the enemy with a well placed illusion, giving Kotlin time to dart ahead and slash at the Necromancer, delaying the nearing completion. A well placed thunderwave takes out many of the skeletons until Lyria pushes ahead and attempts to charm the Necromancer. At the eleventh hour, it works, the ceremony interrupted and a confused wizard, listening to reason. The path is not safe yet, they still must exit, with several obstacles in their path.

The party started to venture out of the dungeon with charmed Necromancer in tow. Passing through the medusa area, Dane was able to reflect her visage back upon herself, turning her to stone. Almost to the exit, the charm ended and the Necromancer turned up on the party. With a quick fight, without preparation and support by the evil wizard, the group was able to dispatch him. His body was brought back to Edgar who rewarded the party as promised.

## Dragon's Horde and Off to Sharn

With information that the University would be sending an expedition down to the crypt themselves, the party was warned by Edgar that if they wanted to try to access the dragon's horde, they must make haste. Arriving back in the ritual room, Kotlin finds a large gear in a chest. Lifting it triggered a cloudkill, almost brining down the gnome. Giving it time to clear, the gear is used on the door.

With great caution, the party proceeds to understand the next room. Two statues each hold a single large gauntlet and an alibastar wall is presented before them. After some experimentation, it is discovered that the gauntlets must be worn to use a special paintbrush on pigments. The pigments are drawn upon the wall and what is drawn seems to almost come alive. The team try a small green dragon, a bird, a frog, a flower, a odd symbol of $, 10 gold coins, a skeletal bird and of course, a donkey. Finally a large blue dragon is added to the mix. All of these wander about the room, friendly to help if they can (which they cannot). Finally, with much thought, the team try to draw a door and the solution is found. Both doors open and access to the horde is granted. Once inside, the room is found to be filled with lead coins, transmuted possibly when the dragon became undead.

Mixed in through out are various magic items. A harp, set of chainmail, a cloak, a bag of tricks, a folded boat, and some gems. After gathering their winnings, the team finishes up in town. Dane finds there is a connection with the Baker Bertha to her cousin who lives in Sharn. Edgar gives each member a letter to bring to Benedict Steele dealing with setting up new employment. His address is given in the Lower Wards of Sharn.
