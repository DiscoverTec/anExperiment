# The Splendors of Sharn

Traveling south to Moonwatch by land, the party hired Captain Spinetack with 7 of his sailors to sail Hurgalor's ship over to Sharn. Upon reaching the city, the party made their way in, finding the marketplace for studded leather as well as several rounds of drinks at the Bull's Head Tavern. Kotlin, all juiced up with his new familiar, did some dropping of eaves on a shady pair, Elyria and Branson. Offered a job by the pair, no agreement was reached as the group finally moved along to the Inn.

The next 10 days were spent on some downtime.

- Kotlin concocted a heist, doubling his investment, managing to barely not be caught. Thankfully no enemies were made.
- Hurgalor could not claim the same. He spent his time with the Twins, Sorg and Torron Crujiente who run 4 restaurants in Sharn and one even over in Wroat. Unfortunately through an accident with a full tray of chicken and sauces, Hurgalor greatly offended Tavon Mizatony a rather loud spellcaster who was on his dinner break.
- Dane spent his time in service of the Grand Cathedral to the Silverflame in Sharn. His grand works even garnered him a favor, still to be used.
- Val was involved with his House, trying to get more into the workings. This brought a good ally in Portia d'Syvis, the Quillmistress of the Sharn Bookery, a publishing establishment used by many.
- Lyria played in many taverns and established an alliance with Mellar Gristlehaus. The owner of the Sparkworks (Foundry and Ironworks down in the Cogs). Mellar was a fan of her music and company.
- Gaz had some work to finish up with the University however was able to take a quick Airship trip to Sharn. For some downtime, he spent his hours studying on alchemy and chemical understanding.

Once completed, the group pulled together to meet up with Benedict Steele PI. Offering the patronage of his boss, Phineas, an agreement was reached. 25 gold per week and living arrangements were setup. Jobs would be pulled together for the team by Benedict.

## The Missing Songbird

The party started their new week in Sharn with Val studying in the appartment while Hurgalor & Lyria trek off in search of lunch. Lyria meets up with Saxony who is playing for a troupe performance in the Upper Ward. After a quick discussion, he gathers her information and says the leader of the troupe will be in contact for including her in future performances. Hurgalor runs into his nemesis Tavon, but things are kept just this side of civil. Dane, Kotlin and Gaz head to the Bull's Head Tavern hoping to find more on Elyria. After Kotlin passes a quick note to the bartender, the trio enjoys a round of drinks.

Meeting with Benedict, the party gets their first job in Sharn. Anastasia d'Lear has disappeared, just as the new production of "The Crystal Dynasty" has started in the Lyric Theatre.

Leon Lector, her manager, has hired the investigators to locate her. The current story is that she has the avian flu and is resting, but that story will only hold for another 3 days. It is important that she not be thought of as 'lost'. The party goes to visit Leon.

On the way, a riot has broken from a Warforged demonstration on one of the path bridges. When a member of House Cannith shows up , violence breaks out. The team manages to get away after a few take some hits from the guards trying to control the situation. Meeting with Leon, and his butler Neilson, they get some background information about Anastasia, her recent activity and answered as many questions as he was able.

Dane went to the Cathedral of Light and spoke with Bishop John. She was last in services on Saturday and was with her boyfriend but they seemed in an argument. She used to go with her best friend Shyla, but has not been off with her for a while.

## Hurg and Lyria get the hook ups

Lyria and Hurgalor break off to go to the Lyric theatre in hopes of getting tickets and meeting with the cast. Arriving at 1pm, the crew was setting up the theatre for the 7pm showing. Showing interest in Anastasia, the pair asked to see the producer Gary Sullivan.

Gary was interested to see them and showed some worry about Anastasia's health, asking them to let him know once they see her. He offered a tour of the theatre. They were able to convince him for 6 tickets as well as VIP passes for the after party, when the cast would all be there. They also managed to unlock the back door of the theatre without anyone noticing.

## Kotlin gets hansy with some stones

Gaz, Val and Kotlin break off to go to her housing in Azure on the Skyway. Without much notice of the guards, the trio arrive to the appartment. Once there, everything is quiet. The bedroom has been tossed as someone was looking for something. A chair in the lounge area had been toppled with a bottle of wine shattered on the floor.

Investigating the room, they found several items to be magical, bricks that started the fireplaces, the rug by the door and a set of 15 stones beneath the bed. In the study, they found a search had been done but not much damage.

Kotlin investigated the stones under the bed that seemed to have a sequence. Entering the wrong sequence, he was teleported to the 'Thiefs Pit' in the prison of Sharn. Locked up, he waited with a murderous halfling until Gaz and Val followed.

Within the hour, they were brought into a questioning room, where they were met by Phineas Rowley, their patron. Clearing them, he was able to get them out of the jam and taken to meet the others at the play.

## The Afterparty

Lyria Hurgalor and Dain went for drinks up at the Airship lounge before venturing to the play. As it kicked off, the other 3 had not been seen or heard from. At intermission, Dain met with them after their stint with the law and the party finished watching the performance all together.

The afterparty had the entire group in attendence. Hurgalor casted zone of truth, to suss out more clues. Talked to the lead actor and Marie, the understudy. It was revealed that Marie believes the sickness is a ruse but glad she has this opportunity , and mentioned a letter, the team has not yet seen.

Talking with Zangeef, the large beared coactor, it seems he believed Anastasia's value to the production. Lyria found a letter and money, paying Marie to help Anastasia get on a skycab with a Green Dragon and red tongue on the side. They speak with another actor who recalls the number 1407 on the side. Kotlin stole gold from Marie's locker in the back. The group then intimate her to find out more information

## Hurg starts some shiz in the Cogs

The group travels to the Green Dragon cab company in the lower level. While there, the dispatch has the cab pulled around to help Lyria get her purse that was left, or so they lied. Speaking with the cabbie, they found that he dropped Anastasia down in the Upper Cogs and takes the troupe to that street.

In the Sandy Caldron tavern across the street from a Warforge steel foundry, they find some who saw the group rush by. They are lead to a market. People in the market mention that the Boromor clan often works close by.

Once in the market, the party picked up information that Anastasia had been lead on by a group of a half orc, a halfling and two humans, all cloaked. In trying to obtain information, the group starts grabbing people for interrogation. A halfling is grabbed and turns out to be a member of the Boromor clan.

Hurgalor is quickly surrounded as the halfling is given the shake down and pressed into the muck. Battle ensues as poison daggers are pulled. Dane holds them off as Hurg is poisoned into a restless slumber. Lyria makes music to distract as Kotlin leads them away to listen to the music instead. Val and Kotlin interigated another of the halflings, getting more information by 'smoozing' one of the leaders. They found that they had been hired simply to deliver Anastasia to the Hugan Foundry, an old abandoned metalworks that some claim is haunted.

## Into the Haunted Foundry

The team, managing to disarm the uproar at the market, head to the haunted foundry. Once there, they break in and start searching around. Val's homunculus finds a 'walking cow', which intrigues the party that they all wish to go see it. Rounding the corner, they come face to face with two minitours. Battle ensues and after a tough pounding, the party is victorious.

## Secret of the Ooze

Kotlin sends Kix to check out more of the haunted foundry. The team further explores what the minitours could have been hiding. Hurgalor finds a mangled dark elf corpse while Lyria discovers several letters from "Demetry" addressed to the mysterious figure "E". Dane and team begin peaking into doors noticing a moving object within one of the rooms. Hurgalor bursts in a fury of exploration discovering a slimy mess of an attacking Ooze creature!

Lyria casts levatate to get a closer look and the team begins battle. Kotlin stealthfully begins opening chests discovering Anastasias cape! The team quickly tries to lock the Ooze in its room taking quite a bit of acid damage they make it out. Hurgalor however was distracted by an open pipe and begins opening the valve work above. Almost on que, the Ooze slimes it way out of the locked room and the battle continues! Kotlin and Dane land sound blows, but quickly notice any many attacks cause the Ooze to split into two a few more attacks and the Ooze was dispatched.

## Tricking a Tiefling

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiscoverTec/anExperiment/main/images/characters/demetry.png" style="width: 300px; float: left; margin: .5rem 1.5rem .5rem 0"/>

Lyria casts invisibility on Kix to examine the foundry to avoid being detected by any other foes nearby. Kix discovers a large room with even more minitours and a Tiefling calling the shots. After some successful eavesdropping the team learns Demetry the Tiefling has plans on blowing up the Haunted Foundry and leaving with Anastasia! The group quickly plans to search for Anastasia knowing she must be somewhere int the Foundry. Lyria casts invisibility on herself to monitor Demetry's movements as he and two of the four minitours leave to the north. Kotlin disguises himself as Demetry to distract the other two minitours instructing them to run as fast as they can to a nearly room with food.

Suddenly Lyria messages that Demetry is returning near the group! As they scramble, Hurgalor is spotted by Demetry and a standoff beings! Kotlin, in a failed attempt to stealth behind Hurgalor, trips over some barrels and he to is exposed! Demetry questions the two, Hurgalor responds the two are a team of "Ghost Busters" sent to inspect the Haunted Foundry. Not convinced, Demetry fires a round of lighting bolts at the group warning them to leave immediately.

Dane and Val regroup with Kotlin and Hurgalor with messaging with Lyria to continue to monitor what Demetry is up to. Eventually Lyria explores the norther section of the Foundry to discover Anastasia bound in a room! Quickly Lyria releases Anastasia leaving a note "I got to her first, LOL" and they escape out of the northern exist of the Haunted Foundry. Kotlin, who had illegally been in contact with Lyria via his Message spell, informs the group they must move north to rejoin with Lyria. The group finds the strange note, but recognize it was written in Lyria's makeup, they assume Lyria must have left with Anastasia.

## They stole her gift!!?

The group exists the Foundry and uses the sending stones to contact Benedict Steel. Lyria wisely reached out to her Noble contacts who also inform Steel they are safe and in route to his office. The team assembles in Benedict Steels office to discover "E" through Demetry have removed Anastaia's voice, her gift. Although deeply troubled, the team moves on and spends some down time in Sharn, before taking on their next adventure
