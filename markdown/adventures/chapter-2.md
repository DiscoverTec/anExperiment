# The Splendors of Sharn

Traveling south to Moonwatch by land, the party hired Captain Spinetack with 7 of his sailors to sail Hurgalor's ship over to Sharn. Upon reaching the city, the party made their way in, finding the marketplace for studded leather as well as several rounds of drinks at the Bull's Head Tavern. Kotlin, all juiced up with his new familiar, did some dropping of eaves on a shady pair, Elyria and Branson. Offered a job by the pair, no agreement was reached as the group finally moved along to the Inn.

The next 10 days were spent on some downtime.

- Kotlin concocted a heist, doubling his investment, managing to barely not be caught. Thankfully no enemies were made.
- Hurgalor could not claim the same. He spent his time with the Twins, Sorg and Torron Crujiente who run 4 restaurants in Sharn and one even over in Wroat. Unfortunately through an accident with a full tray of chicken and sauces, Hurgalor greatly offended Tavon Mizatony a rather loud spellcaster who was on his dinner break.
- Dane spent his time in service of the Grand Cathedral to the Silverflame in Sharn. His grand works even garnered him a favor, still to be used.
- Val was involved with his House, trying to get more into the workings. This brought a good ally in Portia d'Syvis, the Quillmistress of the Sharn Bookery, a publishing establishment used by many.
- Lyria played in many taverns and established an alliance with Mellar Gristlehaus. The owner of the Sparkworks (Foundry and Ironworks down in the Cogs). Mellar was a fan of her music and company.
- Gaz had some work to finish up with the University however was able to take a quick Airship trip to Sharn. For some downtime, he spent his hours studying on alchemy and chemical understanding.

Once completed, the group pulled together to meet up with Benedict Steele PI. Offering the patronage of his boss, Phineas, an agreement was reached. 25 gold per week and living arrangements were setup. Jobs would be pulled together for the team by Benedict.
