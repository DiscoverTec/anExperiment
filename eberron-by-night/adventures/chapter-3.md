The team, gaining a small reputation as the "Ringbar Heros", took on a job from Benedict to find Thomas d'Morar at the beseeching of his wife Karen.

With a few options to travel to Zilspar the group decided to take on a quick escort missing on an airship for one Kilgore Wentworth an art dealer and noble who needed some protection while trafficing art pieces to Victor Calhoon.

Val strongly opposes! The group, still learning about each other, find that Val is extremely terrified of heights. Benedict and the team pursaude Val to travel by air ensuring him nothing would happen and they could even provide some potions to help him sleep the whole duration. Val reluctantly agreed, knowing this is the quickest way to reach Zilspar and an opportunity to learn more about the missing noble.

The team begins working with the airship captian Chuck d'Lauraru. Chuck gives the team a tour of the airship and instructions on how the flying machine works. Hurgalor takes a moment to explore the galley and familiarize himself with the cooking staff. He finds a common bond with the head chef who once worked at one of Hurgs finer restaruants.

After a bit of time, the group learns from Chuck that Thomas has been missing for quite some time and was last seen on a hunting excibision with Victor. A good day is shared by all and the team heads off to grab some rest for the final duration of the trip. They secure Kilgore in his room and keep a watch for anything supicious. Suddly.. a huge comotion is heard on the top deck - trouble!

## That Time We Almost Died to Harpies and Dane Threw His Spear?

> :calendar: 3/16/2022

Kotlin, Dane, and Hurg run to the top deck only to find the airship is under attack by three cocatales and two [harpies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16919-harpy)! Val, who had taken some strong sleeping aids, and Lyria remain below to help guard Kilgore.

The battle begins with several of the crew members joining in defense. The Cocatales and one Harpie land on the airship while the group prepares for battle. Suddendly the Harpie still flying off of the airship begins to sing a dreadfully seductive song to the group. The song can be heard throughout the entire ship even down to Lyira and Kilgores room. Instantly Kotlin, Kilgore, and two crew members are seduced by the Haripie and being walking toward the flying beast. Hurg, Lyria, and Dane are able to eventually shake the song out of their minds. Two of the crew members however, were not as lucky. The crew members both being walking slowly to the edge of the ship and eventually fall off, plumetting to their deaths.

Kotlin snaps out of the trance before reaching the edge and begins to assist Dane and Hurg now deeply embattled with the cocatales. Meanwhile, Kilgore still entranced, starts charging towards the singing harpie. Thankfully Lyira is able to restrain him locking him into his room and eventually curing him from the songs curse. Lyria then rouses Val and they both head towards the top deck.

Dane, summoning some supernatual strength, destroys one of the cocatales single handedly! Kotlin joins Dane as they approach thier second cocatale victem. The flying harpie now lands on the airship joining in battle against our heros. Lyria begins to cast a hypnotic wave above all the creates enchanting them into a silent daze. Val, scared out of his mind at this point, is frozen until Hurg using his superior wit casts a spell granting Val incredible courage. Envigored, Val being attacking with the group.

In an odd turn of events, the once invincible Dane lets his spear slip from his hands completely missing one of the final cocatales completely. The spear teeters on the edge of the ship, Hurg and Val assist in returning it to their tanky companion. Dane, then, again, for some unknown reason, allows his spear to slip from his hands again completely missing the cocatale. This time however, the spear wiffs off the edge of the ship completely, sadly never to be seen again.

After gathering their composure, the group easly defeats the remainging harpy and cocatales. After peace is restored, the ship crew stop to try to find their falled team members. Dane assists and confirms the worst, falling off of a ship is not something anyone should do without a feather fall pack. The airship finally makes it to Zilspar. Kilgore is very thankful and mentions to the group they should visit the art show hosted by Victor.

## Social Hacking for Clues

The group ventures into town stopping at a tavern off the heart of main street. They are greeted by simple towns folk and several local workers. Dane and Val notice a shifty character sitting near the edge of the bar while the rest talk with the bartender. Interested in finding Thomas, they start to ask the bar patrions a few probing questions. They learn this shifty characters name is Blue, a local ranger who prefers living out in the woods. Blue mentions a bit of distaste for Thomas and the other nobles who live in the town. Blue mentions many of these nobles frequent one of the finer taverns located to the north. The group attempts to find more about Blue but he quickly exits giving off a gruff unfriendly vibe to the team.

The group meets Keg the bartender who is working with Flint a brewer. Keg is unable to complete his weekly transaction as there is a bit of a dispute over money management. Hurg and Dane seize the opportunity to buy some excellent beer from Flint! The group continues to probe for information about the missing Thomas, but everyone at this bar seems to have not seen him in quite some time.

The team them goes shopping for a new spear for Dane. Kotlin actually buys Dane a present after performing so well against the harpies. Kotlin in search for an improved weapon, asks the shop keeper, Winfry, about possibly trading some of this deadly purple worm potion stolen from Nestra. Winfry takes Kotlin into a back room and shows him a simple staff that instantly turns into a vicious Ribbonweave. After some haggeling, Kotlin accepts the trade and makes friends with the store merchant who reveals he is actaully a changeling!

Meanwhile, Hurg notices an opportunity for some personal gain. He decides to steal a morning star from the store! Only Kotlin notices Hurgs sneaky plan, although complementing, Kotlin grows a bit concerned as Hurg is starting to show signs of evil??? After talking with all the towns people, the team agrees something strange is happening in the woods and they deicde to give Victor a visit.

## An Art Show

The group heads up to Victors manor where an art show is happening. They find Kilgore who introduces the group to Victor and his family. Fantressa Calhoon is Victors wife and Derek is their son. Derek turns out follows the same path as Keldan the necromancer from Ringbriar. Derek begins to lure Hurg into following his dark path giving Hurg an informative pamflet.

The group sees Plavis on the way out who really wants the team to go on a hunt with him. Interestingly Plavis mentions that Thomas will be at the hunt tonight. While not committing yet, the group lets Plavis know they will think about it.

At the request of Victor, the group ends up joining a later hunt with Victor through Stephen. Stephen is pretty much a bad mofo who has seen some serious shiz. The team decides to continue interving the towns people heading off to Tire the local blacksmith. On their arrival, Lyria gets into a heated argument with Tire the blacksmith however, the group agrees to join tire and plavis in the hunt hoping to find more information about Thomas.

Before heading out on the hunt the team decides to gather some weaponry. Interestingly enough, the team runs into Blue who wans the group to bring silver. At this piont Dane informs the group about werewolfs and how his church are very against the beasts. The group arms up and gets additonal information from the shop keeper.

## The Hunt

> :calendar: 3/31/2022

The group meet up with Plavis, Keg, Tire, and other on the hunt. They see Thomas!!! But he has a big scar on his face. Kotlin, Hurg, and Dane and some rando put their hands into a log and get scratched. Val and Lyria trick the hunters with mage hands and sneaky spells and do not get scratched. The hunt begins! and everyone runs off into the woods

Hurg starts shooting into the dark but actually takes down a boar! Plavis kills the boar but hears a crazy sounds and runs off again. The team enters an ongoing battle between wearwolfs and wearboars. Hurg continues to wildcard shoot at things hitting a wolf. Val, Kotlin, and Lyria group up and do their best to understand the situation lobbing flames and spells at the battle. Kotlin messages the creature to understand what is happening. Dane taunts and directly dues the boar who attacked poor rando guy. Dane is able to speaks with the wereboar. Lyria casts another hypnotic wave, the wolfs leverage their advantage killing a boar who turns into a now dead Blue the ranger!!

Hurg casts calm emotions to settle things down. Kotlin decives the boar apporaching dane to call off his friends. Dane continues to gain information trying to learn what caused the fight. Kotlin messages a wolf he belives to be thomas based on the scars on his face, asking him to stop for his wife's sake. As boar run off, Dane is able to make an agreement with one of the boars to meet at the tavern later

The wolfs attack Val biting him!! Val strikes back viciously but fears we have all been infected by the werewolfs... well except Lyria.

## Kotlin spills the beans about Hurgs Sticky Fingers

> :calendar: 4/14/2022

While heading back to the inn Kotlin reminds the group we need to return the stole morning star to Winfrey. Dane immediatly halts the group demanding more information on what happened and who stole from the store. Kotlin attempts to calmn Dane down after clearly forgetting Dane did not know about Hurgs shopping spree. Kotlin fails any chance of deception horribly, Dane make it extremely clear we will be returning the stolen goods in the morning.

After some well earned rest, Dane immediatly asks for the morning star. Hurg denighs any knowledge of any miss-giving or foul play. Kotlin, feeling a bit responsible for the situation, starts searching when suddenly notices a rather large buldge under Hurgs outer garment. Dane seises the opportunity massaging the buldging morning star out from under Hurgs clothing. The team settles on plans for the day, starting with hitting up the local weapons shop. Oh and now the group is really sure we are werewolfs now, except lyria.

## A Decision

The group settles on visiting with the boars after returning both stolen and borrowed goods from the shop. Winfrey the shop owner agrees to dismiss the robbery after Dane walks him through the crime. Hurg purchases armor for his doney.

Lyria and Kotlin give a call to benedict steel to update him on the status of Thomas. Benedict mentions technically they have completed there work in Zilspar, but offers the group talk with Kent the local magistrate if they want extra pay for addressing the werewolf wereboar war.

The team meets up with Kent careful not to give to much detail about the batteling beasts. Kent is very worried, but clearly has no clue what is happening under his nose. Kent presses for validation of a treat, but Lyria is able to convince him it is best if he doesnt know to much. Kent agrees to pay Benedict and the team the normal fee to set his town back to normal. The team agrees to work with Kent, but decides to check if the boars are at the tavern first

Val and Hurg head out to meet with Flint at Kent's recommendation. Flint recommends meeting with Mondue who was close friends with Blue and may have insight into the werebeast battles. Lyria Kotlin and Dane head over to speak with Blue's last remaining sister. Long story short, Kotlin ends up getting slapped when asking about Blue's remaing debt, which may not really exist, oops.

## Werebears are a Thing as Well

Luckly the group spots Teller and his friends all known wereboars from the night before. The wereboars explain to the team they noticed an uptick in fighting since Thomas visited a grove in the north woods. Teller reveals he is a wereboar by birth. Teller further explains how the werewolfs are extremely agressive and things were peacful until Thomas turned and the werewolfs started to bite others to increase their numbers. Teller mentioned the werewolfs now hunt the wereboars.

The group rejoins mid-day to join Flint as he heads to his farm to meet up with Mondue. They arrive at Mondue's ranch to find a giant bear almost attack them! Suddenly the bear turns into a man named Mondue. Mondue reveals he is a werebear and confirms that the werewolfs and wereboars have been more aggressive later. Mondue suspects that the grove in the forest has turned evil. Mondue also mentions the grove intersects with another etherial plane.

The team agrees to work with Mondue to heal the grove by replanting a special seedling into the grove. The team takes a long rest and gane as much knowledge about the dark forest before heading out.

## Alpha Werewolf, seriously

> :calendar: 4/21/2022

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiscoverTec/anExperiment/main/eberron-by-night/images/characters/alpha-wolf.jpg" style="width: 300px; float: left; margin: .5rem 2rem .5rem 0"/>

The heros head off into the woods armed with all the knowledge from Mondue, a seed, and an incantation to heal the grove. Kotlin and Val send out Bixi and Kix to scout the area. They both detect a number of tree creatures and Kix before being attacked and detroyed, finds a giant Alpha Werewolf.

The hero engage two of the tree creatures. Kotlin is engulphed by one and the team beings to send fire and lighting to destroy the tree freeing a very terrified Kotlin. The tree creatures pack a mighty punch but are eventually destroyed by the team in amazing fashion.

Now aware of the Alpha werewolf, Lyria turns invisible to start scouting more. She notices the center of the grove and a strangely odd and calm Druid near what could be the area a seed should be planted. Meanwhile, Hurg ventures off east towards the river with his donkey (who yes has the seed).

Suddenly another tree creature emerges from the water! A battle begins and Hurg's donkey is attacked and engulphed by the tree monster. Hurg has the idea to possibly explode the donkey if need be, thankfully in a roll of fate, no one is exploded. The team heads over to assist Hurg and the creature is defeated. But the team still needs to determine a plan of attack for the now aware creatures nearby.
