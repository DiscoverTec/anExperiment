# Healing in Stormreach
> :calendar: 6/23/22 

Someone tries to poison Kotlin and Dane.

Kotlin investigates and learns there is a plan to kill the heros because of something Victor is importing.

Hurg and Lyria seem to be very interested in evil books from that kid.

Some lady that Kotlin recognises is found in a bar

They trap the lady in an amazing battle of magic 

They learn that perhaps Victor is up to no good importing this crazy old magic thing.

The heros agree to help the lady and prepare to leave for Stormreach

The group travles off to Stormreach where a gas that negates magic attacked them. 

The group flew to Stormreach with Chuck in a nice airship.

A dragon flies over the moon as they land.

Landed in Stormreach without to much pain.
