## Wherewolfs and WhereBoars? There Boars!

The group in search of Thomas are engulfed in a battle between two viral clans, the wearwolfs and wearboars!

Including Blue, a ranger disliked by many, but he held a special place in the hearts of our heros.

Sandly Blue, a wereboar, was murdered durring a vicious battle between his pack and a rival pack of warewolfs.

Lyria specifically took Blue's death personally.  In an attempt to ease the fighting, she cast a hypnotying spell capturing Blue in her gause.

The nearby werewolfs unaffected took advantage of Blues situation ultimately landing a critical blow ending his life.
